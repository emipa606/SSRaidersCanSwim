Look out! With this mod, raiders can swim through deep water! But that means your colonists can as well...

People can swim through deep water at 4.2% move speed. No other stats are affected while in deep water. Oh, also, they&apos;ll be considered as &quot;lying down&quot; (lower accuracy)

[b]Yes, it works with Rainbeau&apos;s Fertile Fields (Impassable water will be passable) and sd Terraforming remains untested.[/b]
