--- Original Description ---
Look out! With this mod, raiders can swim through deep water! But that means your colonists can as well...

People can swim through deep water at 4.2% move speed. No other stats are affected while in deep water. Oh, also, they'll be considered as "lying down" (lower accuracy)

Yes, it works with Rainbeau's Fertile Fields (Impassable water will be passable) and sd Terraforming remains untested.</description>
