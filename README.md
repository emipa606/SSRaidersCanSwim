Look out! With this mod, raiders can swim through deep water! But that means your colonists can as well...

People can swim through deep water at 4.2% move speed. No other stats are affected while in deep water. Oh, also, they'll be considered as "lying down" (lower accuracy)

**Yes, it works with Rainbeau's Fertile Fields (Impassable water will be passable) and sd Terraforming remains untested.**
